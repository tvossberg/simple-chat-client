To run:
gradle -PmainClass=Server execute

Currently a primative server is implemented which will response on the specified 4 endpoints with dummy responses.

To complete the project the 4 methods of ChatService would need to be completed along with appropriate synchronization to handle concurrent access.
The Server class could do with some more appropriate parsing.
If persistance were required then a database and appropriate persistance could be added.
